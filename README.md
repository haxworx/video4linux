# OpenBSD Video4Linux2 API

As far as I can tell, as of OpenBSD 6.7 the only streaming capabilities
supported are read(2) and mmap(2) based.

Camera I have outputs in YUV and using this to save files in jpeg using
EFL on OpenBSD. See https://enlightenment.org.

Yes, OpenBSD and EFL and Enlightenment is a viable choice on arm64 and
amd64 etc for all sorts of projects.
